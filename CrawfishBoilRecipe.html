          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>I use an outdoor 60qt Boiling Pot, with a cooking basket for this recipe. It allows me to cook an entire sack all
          at once, but use what
          you have readily available. The core ingredients and seasoning can be used for at least one more sack of
          crawfish.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill your pot until only 2-3 lines of the holes in your cooking basket are showing. If you need a more
            specific
            measurement, there should be a maximum fill line inside the pot.</li>
          <li>Rest the basket on the basket rests so that it isn't fully submerged because now "you betta season that
            water!" Take that list of ingredients and put all of them into the basket and put the basket back into the
            pot.</li>
          <li>Fire up the pot and boil the seasonings for at least 30-45 minutes, or until they are falling apart. If
            you
            want to add in Lagniappe ingredients (all EXCEPT the shrimp), the time do so when you have about 15 more
            minutes left in this
            part of the boiling
            process.</li>
          <ul>While boiling the seasonings, purge(clean) your crawfish. I use a crawfish
            washer, but you can use a cooler or a large bucket and use water from the hose to clean them. Stir the water
            so that the dirt starts to come off of the crawfish. Continue this process until the water runs clear. Keep
            them in the water until it is time for them to cook or at least keep them in a shaded area. When it's time
            to pour them in the pot, make sure you have already poured out the water and any sediment from the cleaning
            process.
            Pro tip: Clean them in a cooler that has a spout at the bottom for drainage. Place it at an angle or on an incline so
            the dirty water can flow out as you pour in clean water.</ul>
          <li>Once those ingredients have cooked down, remove everything from the pot and dump them in your cooler or
            wherever you plan on putting the crawfish at once you are finished. Check to make sure any additions like
            the turkey necks and potatoes are done. If they aren't they should remain in the pot so they can continue to
            cook while the crawfish is cooking.</li>
          <li> Now, it is time for "The Star of the Show" For this part take out your timer because you DO NOT want to
            mess this step up. Your basket should be resting on the rests. Pour the entire sack of crawfish into your
            basket.</li>
          <l1>Drop the basket into the boiling water, place the lid on the pot and set your timer for EXACTLY 7 minutes.
          </l1>
          <li>When the timer goes off, turn off your heating source. Now it is time to "soak dem dere mudbugs."
            Add the Budlight, stick of butter, and the 24 ears of corn. Feel free to add some of the seasonings you took
            out of the pot earlier.If you are adding raw shrimp, this is the time to do so.</li>
          <li>Place the lid on the pot and let the crawfish soak for 45 minutes to an hour making sure that you stir the
            pot every 15 minutes. I usually soak mine for an hour.</li>
          <li>When they have soaked up all that good flavor, remove them from the pot and serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ça c'est bon!</p>

          <h2>Perfect Smoked Brisket</h2>
          by: Mario Cabrera
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 whole brisket (9-12lbs)</li>
            <li>Salt (Anything except for sea-salt)</li>
            <li>Lillie's Q Brisket Pepper</li>
            <li>Heinz Yellow Mustard</li>
            <li>1 Bag of large coals</li>
            <li>1 Bag of large cut hickory wood</li>
            <li>1 spray bottle</li>
            <li>1 cup of Motts Apple Juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>Butcher paper</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <p>
            Take the brisket and trim the fat until you are left with a little
            over 1/4 of an inch of fat on the fat cap. Be sure to trim off any
            parts of hard fat. Once the brisket is room temperature, cover the
            entire brisket with yellow mustard to use as a binder for the
            seasonings. Cover the entire brisket in a 50/50 ratio of salt and
            pepper. Be sure to cover every part of the brisket. Once seasoned,
            prepare the smoker by lighting coals and allowing the smoker to get
            to around 180 degrees. Once the smoker is the right temperature, add
            the pieces of hickory wood on top of the coals, and then place the
            brisket in the smoker. While the brisket cooks, fill up the spray
            bottle with an 8:2 ratio of apple juice to apple cider vinegar. Be
            sure to spray the brisket with this mixture every 45 minutes. Once
            the brisket reaches an internal temp of 200 degrees, remove it from
            the smoker and wrap it in the butcher paper. Let it rest for 2
            hours. After it has rested, cut into it and enjoy!

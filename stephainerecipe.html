                <h2>Grandma's Turkey Dressing</h2>
                by Stephaine Gordon
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turkey broth</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 box of cornbread (cooked)</li>
                    <li>1 can of biscuits (cooked)</li>
                    <li>1 onion, cut into pieces</li>
                    <li>Poultry seasoning (to taste, or until your ancestors say to stop</li>
                    <li>Turkey</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>The first time I learned how to make this from my grandmother, she gave me the vaguest
                    directions. This is the best interpretation of that I have been able to write down.</p>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook your cornbread and biscuits separately, according to package directions.</li>
                    <li>Either boil a turkey thigh or use packaged turkey broth. Boil your eggs with in the turkey
                        broth.</li>
                    <li>Let everything cool enough to handle before crumbling the cornbread, biscuits, conion, eggs, and
                        turkey in a deep casserole pan.</li>
                    <li>Add turkey broth until everything is barely submerged.</li>
                    <li>Add poultry seasoning to taste and mix it in.</li>
                    <li>Cook on 400&#176;F until it is hot and is not watery. You'll want it to jiggle like jelly and
                        have a brown crust.</li>
                </ol>
